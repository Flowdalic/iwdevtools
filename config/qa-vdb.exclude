# category/package to exclude entirely from checks
# - see other qa-vdb.exclude-* for more specific type of exclusions
# - simple wildcards can be used
# - can optionally exclude only when checking a specific package
#   e.g. package is known to /not/ use openssl libraries but still uses the
#        openssl binary, then in .exclude-extra (no wildcards on left side):
#        category/my-package = dev-libs/openssl

# category/package to ignore even if they seem superfluous
# e.g. package use bin/openssl but not its libraries, or uses dlopen()

# packages that provide libraries but usually not linked with
dev-lang/perl
dev-lang/python
virtual/perl-* # resolves as dev-lang/perl
virtual/tmpfiles # systemd provider has libraries

# per-package exceptions
app-portage/iwdevtools = sys-apps/file # we don't use libmagic
app-portage/iwdevtools = sys-apps/util-linux # we only use getopt
